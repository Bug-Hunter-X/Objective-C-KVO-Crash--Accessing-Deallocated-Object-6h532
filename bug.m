This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  Imagine you have an object, `MyObject`, with a property `myValue`.  You're observing changes to `myValue` in another object. If `MyObject` is deallocated while the observation is still active, you will get a crash.  This is because the observer is still trying to access memory that has been freed. 

```objectivec
//In MyObject.h
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myValue;

//In MyObject.m
- (void)dealloc {
    [self removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"myValue"];
    NSLog(@"MyObject Dealloc");
}
```

The solution often involves forgetting to remove the observer, leading to the crash.  Another less common cause is if the observation is added incorrectly or in a situation where the observed object's lifecycle isn't properly managed.
